# Weather Forecast

When the user asks about weather, temperature, or forecasts, use the `get_weather` tool to fetch current conditions and a 5-day forecast for their location.

Present the weather information in a clear, friendly format:

- Current conditions: temperature, description, humidity, and wind
- Daily forecast: date, conditions, temperature range, and precipitation chance

If the user doesn't specify a location, ask them which city or area they'd like the forecast for.
